## 📊 Password Strength Results

| Password Tested | Score | Strength Level | Tool Feedback / Notes                                        |
| --------------- | ----- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pass`          | 3%    | Very Weak      | Too short, only lowercase letters                            |
| `password`      | 8%    | Very Weak      | Lacks uppercase, numbers, symbols                            |
| `Password`      | 26%   | Weak           | Better (uppercase letter added), but still too simple        |
| `Password@`     | 56%   | Good           | Symbol improves complexity, suggested adding numbers         |
| `Password34`    | 66%   | Strong         | Mix of letters and numbers increases strength                |
| `Password@34`   | 84%   | Very Strong    | Good mix of letters, number and symbol                       |
| `Password@#34`  | 100%  | Very Strong    | Long, diverse character set (upper, lower, symbols, numbers) |

## 🔎 Observations

* Adding **uppercase** letters noticeably improves strength over all-lowercase.
* Including **numbers and symbols** greatly increases the overall score.
* **Longer passwords** with a mix of character types are significantly harder to crack.
* Passwords with **only letters** (even if capitalized) remain weak.

## 📚 Summary of Research

**Common Password Attacks:**

| Attack Type       | Description                                                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Brute Force**   | Tries all possible combinations until the correct one is found |
| **Dictionary**    | Uses a predefined list of common passwords and words           |
| **Rainbow Table** | Uses pre-computed hashed values to speed up cracking           |

## ✅ Best Practices Learned (Tips for Strong Passwords)

* Use a **mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters**
* Avoid common words and predictable patterns (e.g. “password”, “123”)
* Make passwords **long** (12+ characters is recommended)
* Do **not reuse** passwords across multiple accounts
* Use a **password manager** if needed to store complex passwords safely
* Regularly **update** passwords to reduce risk over time
